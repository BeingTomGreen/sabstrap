sabstrap
==================

### What is this?

sabstrap is a simple theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/), designed to be clean and easy to use on a any device.

I will be using [Bootstrap (v3)](http://getbootstrap.com/) and will try to use only built-in functionality as much as possible.

Rather than hacking on Plush (the default theme), I am going to rewrite from the ground up.

### How to I install it?

* [Download the latest version](https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/sabstrap/archive/master.zip)
* Extract the `sabstrap` folder into `/path/to/sabnzbd/interfaces/sabstrap`
* Select the sabstrap from the available skins (`config->general->skin`)

Alternatively, you can use [`git clone`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics#!clone) directly from GitHub.

### Bugs & compatibility

I will not go out of my way to support older browsers. Generally if [Bootstrap (v3)](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers) works, sabstrap should too, that's it.

If somebody wants to send a pull request adding support for older versions thats fine.

If you think you have found any kind of issue with sabstrap the best thing to do is [create an issue](https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/sabstrap/issues/new).

When creating issues please make sure you check nobody has reported the bug before, if they have comment on that issue instead of creating a new one!
