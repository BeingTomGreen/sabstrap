sabstrap
==================

### WARNING

This is still under development and is probably missing some/most/all of the features normal users need!

### What is this?

![sabstrap v1](http://i.imgur.com/JGwpgOz.png)

sabstrap is a simple theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/), designed to be clean and easy to use on a any device.

I will be using [Bootstrap (v3)](http://getbootstrap.com/) and will try to use only built-in functionality as much as possible.

Rather than hacking on Plush (the default theme), I am going to rewrite from the ground up.

### How to I install it?

* [Download the latest version](https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/sabstrap/archive/master.zip)
* Extract the `sabstrap` folder into `/path/to/sabnzbd/interfaces/sabstrap`
* Select sabstrap from the available skins (`config->general->skin`)
* Restart SABnzbd to see the changes take effect

Alternatively, you can use [`git clone`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics#!clone) directly from GitHub.

### Bugs & compatibility

I will not go out of my way to support older browsers. Generally if [Bootstrap (v3)](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers) works, sabstrap should too, that's it.

If somebody wants to send a pull request adding support for older versions thats fine.

If you think you have found any kind of issue with sabstrap the best thing to do is [create a new issue](https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/sabstrap/issues/new).

When creating issues please make sure you check nobody has already reported the issue, if they have comment on that issue instead of creating a new one!

You can also post on the [Sabnzbd forum thread I started](http://forums.sabnzbd.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=15367).

### Thanks & contributors

I found [Arno Fortelny's](https://twitter.com/aforty) [Knockstrap theme](https://github.com/aforty/sabnzbd-knockstrap) invaluable as documentation for creating new themes is scarce!

Big love to [Mark (mdo)](http://twitter.com/mdo), [Jacob (fat)](http://twitter.com/fat) [et al](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors) for creating and maintaing [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
